# scsb-export
[![travis](https://travis-ci.org/NYPL/scsb-export.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/NYPL/scsb-export/)

Converts ILS MARC Binary export to SCSB middleware schema for the shared collection ReCAP project.

This process expects you have a MARC binary (.mrc) file exported from the ILS export table designed for this process, here is [how it looks in XML](https://gist.github.com/thisismattmiller/d4869c71eedb8f4e043f42bab576fe2d) (since it is hard to view binary MARC) and a barcode file that will look something [like this](https://github.com/NYPL/scsb-export/blob/master/test/barcode.test.txt). You run the mrc2scsb.js on these two files and it will produce a XML file in the middleware schema.

To get started

- Install node + npm (**requires node 5.x due to an old libxmljs dependency**)
- `git clone https://github.com/NYPL/scsb-export.git`
- `npm install`
- run mrc2scsb.js with the parameters --marc for the MARC file and --barcode for the barcode

For example if I wanted to run it on one of the test files I would execute:

```
node mrc2scsb.js --marc "test/test_multiple_callnumbers.mrc" --barcode "test/barcode.test.txt" 

```
This will create a new XML file called `test/test_has_866_converted.xml` and also a log file called `test/test_has_866_converted.log`

You can also tell it to start or stop if you only want to process X number of records

```
--start 1
--stop 5000
```

Means only process the first 5000 records in the file

---
###Errors
There are a number of errors that can occur and be reported in the log file, here is a list:

`852 missing inumber` - an item's 852 feild is missing its subfield a

`876 missing inumber` - '' 876

`852|b missing` - missing subfield b location code

`876|k missing` - missing subfield k location code

`852 missing` - missing this field for an item

`852 missing` - ''

`Missing barcode: no 876|p` - missing the barcode from the item

`Barcode not found in lookup file` - barcode in item not found int lookup file

`Missing callnumber in items` - something went very wrong, no call number for an item

---

###Tests
`npm test` will run the test suite and also generate the example/test files found in `test/examples/*.mrc`


---

###XML Format
The resulting XML file will not be pretty printed but will be well formed with each `<bibRecord>` on its own line terminated with a `\n`:

```
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<bibRecords>
  <bibRecord><bib><owningInstitutionId>NYPL</owningInstitutionId>...
  <bibRecord><bib><owningInstitutionId>NYPL</owningInstitutionId>...
  <bibRecord><bib><owningInstitutionId>NYPL</owningInstitutionId>...
  <bibRecord><bib><owningInstitutionId>NYPL</owningInstitutionId>...
  ...
</bibRecords>
  
```

This would allow someone to stream the file line-by-line to access all the records.
